# Pokemon-Battle-Simulator
Hello there, DR4G0NW4RR10R here, and this is my Pokémon Battle simulator.
I made this project in Python 3, and I am improving it as time goes on, adding
more little features and things. Currently, this project had over 1200
lines of code!

This is not a perfect game, and there will be bugs. If you do find a bug or
two, please do let me know and I will do my best to patch it up.

If you would like a specific feature added, let me know and I'll see if I can
implement it.

Special thanks to my beta testers for being amazing and trying this game:
- No one yet :*(



Here are the basics of the game:

The Pokémon Battle Simulator is a simulator to simulate two Pokémon fighting
each other. You, the player, can specify almost all aspects of these Pokémon.
If you have an existing save file, it will have the information of the two
Pokémon that have been made. Included by default is a single save file to
serve as a preset battle, should you be interested.

Alternitavely, you can create two brand new Pokémon to battle with and pit
them up against each other! If you do this, you will be prompted to enter
information for these Pokémon.

Please note that currently, Status, Abilities, and Pokémon Nature are
unimplemented, they cannnot be utilized in battle.
